# Depression-Risk-Classification-Among-University-Students-Using-Machine-Learning #

Depression among university students is a growing mental health concern, often influenced by academic pressure, lifestyle factors, and personal well-being. This project applies machine learning as a decision-support and business intelligence tool to predict depression risk and provide interpretable insights using explainable AI techniques.

Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were developed using a publicly available student depression dataset from Kaggle. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. To enhance transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to identify key features contributing to depression risk predictions. The results demonstrate how predictive and explainable analytics can support early risk identification, targeted awareness initiatives, and data-driven mental health prevention planning, without providing medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The following models are trained and evaluated:

### Logistic Regression

- Serves as a baseline linear classification model

- Provides strong interpretability and transparency

### Decision Tree

- Captures non-linear relationships between features

- Enables intuitive rule-based decision making
